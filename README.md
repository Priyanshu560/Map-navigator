Map Navigator

This is a simple Java project that finds the shortest path between two points using Dijkstra's algorithm. It simulates a small map with nodes and distances and helps the user find the shortest route.

Features:
- Allows user to input source and destination nodes
- Uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path
- Shows the path taken and total distance

How to Run:
1. Make sure Java is installed on your system
2. Open the terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the folder containing the file
4. Compile the code using:
   javac MapNavigator.java
5. Run the program using:
   java MapNavigator

Sample Input:
Enter source node: A  
Enter destination node: Z

Sample Output:
Shortest path from A to Z: [A, C, B, D, E, Z]  
Total distance: 14 units
